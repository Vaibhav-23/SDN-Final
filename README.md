I have developed a ready-made login/signup screen. This app can welcome users with this beautiful animated screen that gives functionality for both login and sign up.

To run this app you should have an emulator(Android Studio or Xcode) and Flutter installed on the PC.

I'm using Flutter as the front end and Firebase as the back end.
